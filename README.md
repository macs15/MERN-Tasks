# MERN-Tasks
An application with a CRUD of tasks in projects which requires authentication and allows the creation of new user accounts. The backend of this app is made with **node.js** and belongs to a separate repository.

*This is a project based on Juan Pablo de la torre's React course.*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
